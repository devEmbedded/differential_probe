Modular differential probe (DEDP-100)
=====================================

This repository contains the design files of a 100 MHz differential probe
for use with oscilloscopes. The design is modular and consists of a base
amplifier unit with exchangeable probe tip accessories. The accessory can
be chosen to fit the desired voltage range and connection type.

Currently this project is still in development. While the prototype revisions
work well, they are still being redesigned for improvements.
