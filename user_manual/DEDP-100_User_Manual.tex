\section{Introduction}

A differential probe measures the voltage difference between the two input contacts.
Unlike a regular oscilloscope probe, neither of the contacts have a direct connection to ground.
This allows measurements of circuits that have a different reference potential than the oscilloscope ground is.

\section{Parts and functionality}

The DEDP-100 Differential Probe consists of a differential amplifier,
detachable input accessories and a triaxial cable to oscilloscope.
The triaxial cable contains an inner 50 ohm coaxial cable to pass the output signal and an outer shield that carries supply current for the amplifier.
The USB power supply connector can be connected to oscilloscope USB port or a separate 5 VDC power supply.

The amplifier has fixed differential gain settings of 2x and 20x gain and input voltage range of $\pm3\,V$.
The actual measurement range and total system gain is set by a divider included in input accessories.
Two coaxial MCX connectors are provided on the front for attaching shielded cable accessories.
Alternatively, two slots with spring loaded contacts accept tweezer tip accessories.
In both types of accessories, the input divider is located near the probe end, to minimize stray capacitance.

\section{Adjustment after accessory change}
\label{adjustment}
This differential probe can be adapted to different measurement ranges by using interchangeable probe accessories.
Because of component tolerances, an adjustment procedure is required after accessory change to achieve the best
frequency response flatness, common mode rejection and output offset performance.

Adjustment is performed by two trimmer capacitors and two trimmer resistors, accessible through holes in the top cover.
The trimmer capacitors are marked \textbf{AC+} and \textbf{AC-} and adjust the high-frequency gain to make it equal to low-frequency gain.
The trimmer resistors are marked \textbf{DC balance} and \textbf{DC offset} and adjust the low frequency characteristics.
Suitable adjustment tool is 1.5 mm wide flat head screwdriver.
Both conductive and non-conductive tools are suitable.

Adjustment requires use of a square wave source.
Most oscilloscopes include a calibration output that is suitable for the purpose.
A signal generator can also be used: set it to square wave, 1 kHz, 3 Vp-p.
If a separate signal generator is used, connect its ground terminal to oscilloscope ground.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Frequency response flatness:} Connect positive input probe to square wave signal and negative to ground.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set probe gain switch to 2x.
\item Set oscilloscope vertical scale and timebase so that the signal is visible.
\item Adjust \textbf{AC+} until rising signal edges are sharp without overshoot (see figure X).
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Common mode rejection:} Connect both positive and negative probe to square wave signal.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set probe gain switch to 20x.
\item Set oscilloscope vertical scale to 100 mV/div.
\item Adjust \textbf{AC-} until rising edge spikes of the signal are removed.
\item Adjust \textbf{DC balance} until the displayed signal is a flat line (see figure X).
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{DC offset:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set probe gain switch to the setting you will use for measurements.\\There is a small difference in offset between the gain settings.
\item Adjust \textbf{DC offset} until output signal is 0 V.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Oscilloscope settings}
\subsection{Termination impedance}
The differential amplifier has $50\,\Omega$ output impedance.
It is compatible with both $1\,M\Omega$ or $50\,\Omega$ impedance oscilloscope inputs.
Using $50\,\Omega$ termination is recommended for measurement of signals with frequency higher than 20 MHz,
as it removes gain fluctuations caused by reflections in the signal cable.
Using $1\,M\Omega$ termination is recommended for signals with amplitude below 1\% of total range,
as it doubles the signal level visible at the oscilloscope input.
Figure \ref{fig_termination} shows the frequency response with both termination types.

Many high bandwidth oscilloscopes have a software option to select the termination impedance.
For oscilloscopes without this setting, an inline $50\,\Omega$ terminator such as P57 or Cal Test CT2944 can be used.

    \label{fig_termination}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Probe ratio}
Most digital oscilloscopes contain a probe ratio setting to display correct voltages for on-screen measurements.
For this differential probe, the total attenuation ratio and thus the correct oscilloscope setting depend on three parameters:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Input accessory attenuation ratio, typically 1:20 or 1:200.
\item Differential gain switch setting, either 2x or 20x.
\item Oscilloscope termination attenuation, which is 1:1 for $1\,M\Omega$ termination and 1:2 for $50\,\Omega$ termination.
\end{enumerate}

The table below shows the correct oscilloscope setting for most common configurations:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l|C{2cm}|C{2cm}|X}
\thickhline
& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textbf{Accessory ratio}} \\

\section{Accessories}
\subsection{1:20 tweezer tips}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{cX}
    \raisebox{-4mm}{\warning} & The tweezer tip accessory is suitable only for measurement of safe low voltage circuits. Do not use it with circuits connected to hazardous voltages. \\
\end{tabularx}

The tweezer tip accessory is designed for measurement of low voltage signals on printed circuit boards.
The tips have a gold plated contact surface on the inside and an insulating surface on the outside.
This allows inserting the tip between integrated circuit leads without causing a short-circuit.
For hands-free usage, a rubber band or a piece of heatshrink tubing can be used to keep the tweezer closed around a component.

The divider circuit is placed close to the tip to minimize parasitic capacitance.
It consists of a $110\,\Omega$ series damping resistor, $9.53\,M\Omega$ divider resistor and $2.0\,pF$ compensation capacitor.

To install the detachable tweezer tips, push them firmly into slots on the sides of the amplifier enclosure.
Verify that the tweezer ends meet when pressed together.
To remove, pull straight outwards to release the taper fit.
Remove tweezer tips when using a cable accessory, as having two accessories simultaneously connected will affect the frequency response.

The gold coating on the tips may wear out in heavy use.
The tips can be resharpened using a file or sand paper to remove the worn out part.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Measurement range (common mode + differential)}: $\pm60\,V$ to output GND
\item \textbf{Measurement range (differential): $\pm36\,V$}
\item \textbf{Absolute maximum voltage}: $\pm150\,V$ to output GND
\item \textbf{Measurement category}: 60 V -- CAT I (circuits not connected to mains)
\item \textbf{Input capacitance (nominal)}: 1.5 pF each side to GND
\item \textbf{Input capacitance (in typical measurement setup)}: 3 pF each side to GND, 3 pF differential
\item \textbf{Input resistance}: $10\,M\Omega$ each side to GND
